1.  To ensure that the size of that int or other data types will be same size on any system (a 32-bit int on a 32-bit system will be still a 32 bit int on a 64-bit system.
2.  To tell how many bits you want that variable to store.
3.  BYTE == 1 byte
    DWORD == 4 bytes
    LONG == 4 bytes
    WORD == 2 bytes
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file has to be 0x4d42 in hex or BM in ASCII.
5.  The "bfSize" variable contains the size of the bitmap file.
    The "biSize" variable is the number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  The bitmap is a top-down DIB.
7.  The biBitcount variable.
8.  The file isn't in the directory or couldn't open it.
9.  Because the person who wrote this program wants to only read the first int of that file.
10. 3 bytes
11. Allows you to jump to a certain point of the file.
12. SEEK_CUR is used with in with seekf to start where the 2nd argument tell it to start from.
