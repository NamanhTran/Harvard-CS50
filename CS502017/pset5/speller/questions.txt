1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

    Getrusage() returns resource usage measures for a variable.
    
2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

    There are 16 members in struct rusage.
    
3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

    We pass it by reference because it is a pointer.
    
4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

    The for loop gets one char at a time from the file and checks if it's an alphabetical char. If the word exceeds the max LENGTH then it ignores that string. If it doesn't it the word gets terminate then gets put through the check function. If the function returns false it spells out the word on the screen, if it returns true it doesn't print the word onto the screen.
    
5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?

    Fscanf requires you to have a buffer with reserved memory for it. One problem that would arise is that some words might be shorter than others and some spare memory will go to waste and larger words will not have enough memory.

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

    They are pointers and they are able to change the actual value
